<b>run_analysis.R</b> helps with two problems as follows

1. Extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
   with descriptive activity names. Use ```get_mean_std()``` function.

2. Tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   And this dataset is written to file "tidy_data.txt".
